## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your Trello API key and token are correct
   - Check that your API token has the necessary permissions
   - Ensure your Trello account is active

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify your Trello user has necessary board/card permissions
   - Check board access rights for the operations you're trying to perform
   - Ensure you're a member of boards you're trying to modify

3. **404 Errors**
   - Verify that card, board, list, or action IDs are correct
   - Use `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_CARDS_BY_ID_BOARD` to get valid card IDs
   - Check that resources haven't been deleted or moved

4. **Field Access Errors**
   - Use "all" as field value to get complete data
   - Check available fields using the "all" option first
   - Verify field names are correct (case-sensitive)

5. **API Limitations**
   - Some endpoints may be deprecated (voting, direct session management)
   - Use alternative approaches for unsupported operations
   - Check Trello API documentation for current endpoint status
